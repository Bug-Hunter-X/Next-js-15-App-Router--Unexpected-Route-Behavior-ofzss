# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when navigating between pages within a Next.js 15 application using the App Router.  The issue involves the route unexpectedly redirecting or not updating the UI as expected.

## Description
The problem is that after navigating to a different route and then back to the original route, the component doesn't re-render or correctly update the state. It seems like the initial state or component tree is retained and not properly refreshed when navigating back.  This might manifest as stale data or UI elements persisting even after a route change.
